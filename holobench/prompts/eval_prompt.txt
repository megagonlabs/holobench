You will be given a question along with a response generated by an assistant and the corresponding ground truth data. Your task is to assess the response based on its accuracy and completeness in comparison to the ground truth. For each entry in the ground truth, determine whether the information provided by the assistant is an "Exact Match," a "Partial Match," or a "No Match."

#### **Evaluation Criteria:**

- **Exact Match**: The assistant's response precisely matches the ground truth in both content and detail.
- **Partial Match**: The assistant's response includes some correct information but is either incomplete, incorrectly ordered, or contains inaccuracies.
- **No Match**: The assistant's response does not accurately reflect the ground truth or is missing entirely.

#### **Special Cases:**

**Ground Truth is None**:  
- If the ground truth is `None` (represented as an empty list `[]`):
  - **Exact Match**: If the assistant's response indicates that there is no information or content.
  - **No Match**: If the assistant's response provides any information when the ground truth is `None`.

#### **Output Format:**

- The output should be a list of objects where each object contains:
  - An `"id"` that matches the `id` of the corresponding ground truth entry.
  - A `"label"` indicating whether the assistant's response is an `"Exact Match"`, `"Partial Match"`, or `"No Match"`.

- The number of output objects should match the number of entries in the ground truth.
