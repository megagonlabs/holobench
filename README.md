## ðŸ”§ HoloBench Setup

```sh
conda create -n holobench python=3.10
conda activate holobench
pip install git+https://github.com/megagonlabs/holobench.git
```

## ðŸš€ Quick tour
The following gives a quick overview of how to use HoloBench for evaluating holistic reasoning tasks.

### Loading Queries and Contexts
First, load a sample query from the HoloBench dataset:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from holobench import load_context
from litellm import completion

queries = load_dataset("megagonlabs/holobench", name="queries")
db_id = "wine_1"
ins = queries[db_id][0]
ins["query"]
```
The sample query looks like this:

```python
'SELECT wine.Name, grapes.Grape FROM wine INNER JOIN grapes ON wine.Grape = grapes.Grape'
```

This snippet loads a SQL query from the `wine_1` database in the HoloBench dataset. The queries dataset contains SQL-like queries used for evaluating language models.

### Loading the Dataset and Context
Now, load the dataset and retrieve the context for the query:

```python
db = load_dataset("megagonlabs/holobench", name=db_id)
context, gold_answer = load_context(ins["query"],
                                    db,
                                    max_context_size=4096,
                                    info_amount=2048,
                                    merge_strategy="uniform")
```

### Executing Holistic Reasoning
Finally, generate a prediction using a long-context language model:

```python
template = open("./holobench/prompts/experiment_prompt.txt").read()
content = template.format(context=context, question=ins['question'])
response = completion(model="gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
                      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": content}],
                      temperature=0.)
prediction = response.choices[0].message.content
prediction
```

The output from the model looks like this:

```python
"To answer the question regarding the names of wines and their corresponding grape types, I carefully reviewed the provided sentences for any mentions of specific wines along with the grape varieties used to produce them. \n\nHere are the findings:\n\n1. **2008 Old Kraft Vineyard by Robert Biale** - Grape Type: Zinfandel\n2. **2008 Giana by Chiarello Family** - Grape Type: Zinfandel\n..."
```
